I have delevoped this weekly scheduler app using NodeJS and ReactJS. 

I imported scheduler component to my app from @syncfusion/ej2-react-schedule. Syncfusion provides their components to individuals for free. Syncfusion React Scheduler is an event calendar which facilitates user with the common Outlook-calendar features, thus allowing the users to plan and manage their events/appointments and its time in an efficient way. There are 10 different view models such as week, month, year, timeline week etc. I only used week view and customized it to make it more simple and clear for my aims.

I also imported tree view component from @syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations. I used it for displaying wildcards in a tree-list view.

I used Axios as HTTP client. All get requests called once when user gets in the website.

Finally, I imported a free nice looking button as downloader to make page nicer.

This is my first website project. I have tried to learn JavaScript-TypeScript basics, ReactJS, little bit HTML and CSS, API usage etc. at once. I tried my best, and I enjoyed it very much.
